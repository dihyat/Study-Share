====== Ego ======
--------------------
Ego â†’ aspect of yourself as "you". Self imaged of yourself. The I, the emotions + thoughts you identify with. Beliefs of reality

You seperate yourself with reality e.g. your body and table is not the same. Biologically, we are I to surivie!
Everything you do is dedicated by the ego. If you kill the ego, the ego would suggest that the world and reality itself will collapse, but it won't! You must numb the ego.

== Boundary ==
There is no boundary between ego/body with the universe. You are not a special snowflake in the universe, since you are the universe.You are not separate from the table, you are the table. WE ARE EVERYTHING TOGETHER. Stop being you and be the universe!
--------------------

====== What is wrong with the Ego? ======
You could ask questions like what's wrong with ego, so what if I am trying to improve, trying to get sucess, money, building identity, or beliefs/systems and structures, shouldn't this give me happiness? Ultimately, the ego is actually what causes the unhappinesses. 
It is like spitting into the wind, it comes to your face. This happens immediately but with ego, it is more complex because the spit does not come straight away because the ego is sneaky and based on self-deception. It is subtle and conditioned overtime. By the time the spit comes to your face, you don't realise it was the ego who spat on you, but you blame somebody else, who was that fucker who spat at me.

**Ego** - What you believe what you are right now. It's not an aspect or evil. It is not aggorance. It is not just selfish, but it's a more expanded defintion of selfish, which includes the being of a human. Your entire life is revolving around. When we talk to people, we only look at them as a object, or a soul in your mind, or just a body. This is ego, it is the entire identification of you made of your body, soul and brain. It is your basic needs for your surivialiblity of your existences.
Your identity is how you made your story, where you're from, where you grew up, who were your parents, etc but this is not physically true. It's only ideas in your mind, and various images that has been wedged into you and you believe it IS you. THIS is the ego.

What's wrong with ego? It is every problem you have in your life, whatever it is.

What if all of this stuff is because of ego and not inherited from life? Consider this as the defense mechnanism by the ego. Life seems bad because of the ego. This is a list created by the ego, the backfiring conquence. So why is ego wrong? This is why...

 We are not saying don't surivie. We are saying be more responsible on how you surivie. Don't just pointlessly follow your ego, your instincts.
The ego isn't absolutely bad. There is nothing wrong with it. It just causes suffering for you, so then stop the ego for the suffering. If you do actually like suffering, then actually continue with the ego. You can suffer if you want to. It is just pleasant to your loved ones, yourself, and others.

Happiness = 1/ego
when you have a reciprocal, if you have a very high ego and 1 over the variable, then the lower the happiness. So the higher the happiness, the lower the ego. This is the function that governs you life.

**NOTICE WHAT YOUR EGO IS DOING. NOT A MORAL ISSUE BUT A MECHANISM**
